## Generator Overview

***

This software framework is developed to run Monte Carlo (MC) based simulation of neutrino interactions producing two high energy outgoing muons from/near the interaction vertex, known as dimuon events. The two major physics processes producing these events are charm production in charge-current (CC) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and trident interaction of muon neutrino netrinos ($\nu_{\mu}$). With the large statistics of detected neutrinos in neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube and P-ONE and in collider neutrino experiments such as FASER$\nu$ and SND@LHC can probe into various Standard Model and Beyond Standard Model tests, e.g. QCD Physics, Parton Density Functions, SM extension models, and SUSY models.
